# Group Project 3 - Shop Workload App

## Project Description:
 Our project is a workflow control app that attempts to streamline all workflow in 
 a shop.

  * This app will create a high level of effenciency within a shop environment by:
    1. Assigning jobs based on the work to be done.
    2. Workstations are sequentially assigned in order of work to be done.
    3. Workflow is assigned for maximum effeciency and cannot be changed.
    4. Job documentation is digitally attached to each job to further enhance effenciency.

  * The app has authentication to both employee (workflow) and admin (job planning/access):
    1. There is a unified login page for both Administrator and Employees.
    2. Administrators can create, assign and update jobs/workflow.
    3. Employees can see work assigned to their workstation and what must be accomplished.
    4. Admin login will allow you to update the entire system. 


## Assignment Requirements: 

- `Must use ReactJS.`
- `Must use a Node and Express Web Server.`
- `Must be backed by a MySQL or MongoDB Database with a Sequelize or Mongoose ORM.`
- `Must have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.`
- `Must be deployed using Heroku (with Data).`
- `Must utilize at least two libraries, packages, or technologies that we haven't discussed.`
- `Must allow for or involve the authentication of users in some way.`
- `Must have a polished frontend / UI.`
- `Must have folder structure that meets MVC Paradigm.`
- `Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming).`

## Technologies Used:

- `ReactJS`
- `Node`
- `Express`

## Additional Technologies Used:

The following `Additional Technologies` are used **with approval** and provide 
not only new technologies for this assignment, but also override some of the
requirements for this assignment. In particular, we are not backed by a MySQL
or MongoDB Database or a Sequelize or Mongoose ORM. As well as not being deployed
using Heroku. All of these requirements are being met by all of the `Firebase Componants`
listed below:

- `Cloud Firestore` -is a NoSQL document database that lets you easily store, 
   sync, and query data for your mobile and web apps - at global scale.

- `Firebase Authentication` -makes building secure authentication systems easy. 
   It is a secure end-to-end identity solution supporting email and password 
   accounts among others.

- `Firebase Cloud Functions` -allow you to develop a backend without servers. 
   You can create functions that are triggered by Firebase products, such as 
   changes to data in the Realtime Database or new user sign-ups.

- `Firebase Cloud Storage` -allows you to store and serve content with relative 
   ease. It is designed to help you quickly and easily store and serve user-generated 
   content which can include photos and videos.

- `Firebase Hosting` is fast and secure web hosting that can deliver content 
   very quickly. You will be able to deliver web content fast. You can deploy a 
   single-page web app, a mobile app landing page or a progressive web app without 
   all the hassle.
